       "     'claim: the centers for disease control and prevention quietly confirmed that at least 118,000 children and young adults have died suddenly in the u.s. since the covid-19 vaccines rolled out. the facts: the cdc has confirmed no such thing. the claim misrepresents cdc data around excess deaths  the difference between the observed number of deaths and the expected number in a specific period. a misleading article spreading widely online attempts to link recent child and young adult deaths in the u.s. to covid-19 vaccines. cdc quietly confirms at least 118k children & young adults have died suddenly in the usa since the roll-out of the covid vaccines, reads its headline. the article originally appeared in november on the expos, a website that has repeatedly spread covid-19 misinformation. a screenshot of the articles headline was shared in multiple facebook and instagram posts. as evidence, the article cites cdc data as published by the organisation for economic co-operation and development, an intergovernmental organization that promotes sustainable growth. as presented by the expos, the data shows that there were about 118,000 excess u.s. deaths in the 0-to-44 age group between december 2020 and october 2022, compared to the 2015-2019 average. the article suggests that these deaths are the result of the covid-19 vaccines, saying that the mysterious sudden rise which has contributed to half a million american children and young adults dying since late 2020, is most likely due to the covid-19 injections. but brian tsai, a spokesperson for the cdcs national center for health statistics, told the associated press that the claim distorts cdc data. tsai said that from the start of 2021 to the 43rd week of 2022, there have been about 124,000 excess deaths in the u.s. among 0- to 44-year-olds compared to the 2015-2019 average. tsai said his number is higher than those published by oecd because the cdcs data is now more complete. theres no indication covid-19 vaccines caused these excess deaths, he said. confirmed reports of deaths caused by vaccination are extremely rare, even with millions of covid-19 vaccine doses having been administered in the u.s. scott pauley, a spokesperson for the cdc, told the ap that outside of nine deaths confirmed to be associated with rare blood clots following the johnson & johnson vaccine, the agency has not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunization that would indicate that covid vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths. tsai said likely reasons for excess deaths in this age group since 2020 include suicides, homicides, heart diseases, liver disease, diabetes and accidental deaths including drug overdoses. he added that a substantial number of the excess deaths are the result of covid-19 itself. a surge in excess deaths among children and young adults in the summer of 2021, for example, corresponded with the delta variant of the coronavirus hitting the u.s., which affected younger people more than previous variants of the virus, tsai said. cdc data from december 2021 indicated that covid-19 was the third leading cause of death in the u.s., behind heart disease and cancer. experts have said drug overdoses also contributed to higher-than-expected death rates in 2021, the ap reported. tsai also refuted the headlines claim that the cdc has quietly confirmed data about children and young adults dying suddenly. the cdcs excess death data has long been public, he said, and there is no way to really determine from the data whether people died suddenly or not. experts told the ap that there is no evidence to support the claim that the vaccines caused the excess deaths. \"excess deaths so obviously increased dramatically during the covid-19 pandemic that were able to, with some level of confidence, say that covid was causing those excess deaths, said spencer fox, an assistant professor in epidemiology and biostatistics at the university of georgia. oecd and the expos did not respond to requests for comment.',\n",

       "    'top_k_doc': ['wisconsin gov. scott walker raised $7.4 million for his short-lived presidential bid but spent his cash as quickly as it came in, leaving the campaign with a debt of at least $1 million once all the bills roll in, according to sources and a report filed with federal elections officials thursday.as of the end of last month, the campaign had spent $6.4 million, with more unpaid bills still showing up. the campaign burned through about $90,000 a day without even running major broadcast ads, doing so months before the first votes are cast.the full extent of the deficit may not be revealed until the campaign files its next report with the federal election commission in january. sources familiar with the campaign\\'s situation said it will take many months to pay off the roughly $1 million debt and described it as a \"campaign nightmare.\"the figures provide perspective on the challenges and missteps that undid walker and on a debt that could serve as a drag on his political prospects going forward. he dropped out of the race on sept. 21, unable to sustain financially a candidacy that had soared early. he raised and spent money aggressively and then faced plummeting polling and donations.contributions to walker\\'s campaign peaked in july with $2.4 million, but dropped by 50 percent in august, the month when he was deemed to have given a tepid performance in the first gop debate.donations dropped even further in september but spending stayed strong. the governor\\'s campaign manager made more than $50,000 for 71 days of work, while walker\\'s sons matt and alex drew nearly $10,000 in salary between them over those 10 weeks.the republican governor spent over 86 percent of what he took in between july and september. by comparison, the presidential campaign of u.s. sen. marco rubio of florida, who raised a similar sum to walker over the past three months, said he had a \"burn rate\" of 40 percent.other candidates such as former florida gov. jeb bush were also spending money quickly but had gotten into the race earlier, raised more in previous months and still have money left.as of sept. 30, walker\\'s federal account had $985,200 in it and his campaign had debts and obligations of $161,100, according to the filing. but his campaign wouldn\\'t say how much more in incoming bills was left to pay.the wall street journal first reported on the looming campaign shortfall.\"while the outcome is obviously not what we had hoped for, the (fundraising) reflects strong grass-roots support for his vision of taking the power out of washington and returning it to the people,\" campaign spokesman tom evenson said. \"too many americans worry that our nation is heading in the wrong direction, but governor walker is hopeful the eventual republican nominee will champion an optimistic conservative vision that both inspires and offers a clear choice in 2016.\"a source said that there had also been financial challenges for our american revival, a so-called 527 group which served as walker\\'s presidential campaign in waiting during the first half of 2015. the extent of those is not yet clear _ an official for the group had no immediate comment thursday and the group\\'s most recent filing with federal tax officials covers only the period up until june 30.in the first half of the year, our american revival raised $6.2 million and spent $5.1 million.rick wiley, walker\\'s presidential campaign manager and the former head of our american revival, has pushed back criticism that he and the governor presided over an ill-advised spending spree for the campaign.\"we didn\\'t have a spending problem. we had a revenue problem,\" wiley said last month.but reports show heavy spending, including at least $1.9 million in payroll to staffers, some of whom drew five-figure monthly salaries. that wouldn\\'t necessarily include payments to potentially high-priced consultants.wiley himself was making about $16,250 per month, which would have totaled an annual salary of nearly $195,000 per year if the bid had continued. as it was, wiley drew down $51,910 for his 71-day oversight of the unsuccessful effort.four other campaign employees did even better: the governor\\'s political director, matt mason, pulled down $61,000 over those 10 weeks; walker\\'s communications director, kirsten kukowski, made $58,000; and walker\\'s treasurer, kate lind, was paid $57,700; and jonathan waclawski, an attorney for the campaign, was paid $57,600.walker\\'s sons, matt and alex, who took the fall semester off of college to campaign with their father, each made about $1,540 per month in salary for a total of $9,652.the campaign also spent more than $1.1 million for mail pieces sent directly to potential donors or voters.the approximately $161,000 still owed by the campaign includes $10,500 owed to the waukesha county expo center, where walker\\'s campaign kickoff event was held in july.other outstanding debts include $54,400 owed for facility rental and catering services to the union league club, a swanky social club in new york city, and $44,200 owed for \"event staging\" to mma events llc in maryland.the campaign also still owes some companies for online advertising, including $42,200 owed to exact drive and $34,100 owed to milwaukee-based connectivist media.walker raised more than a number of other republicans, including rubio, former hewlett-packard executive carly fiorina, new jersey gov. chris christie, and u.s. sen. rand paul of kentucky, according to totals reported for those candidates by media such as the new yorker and politico.but bush and former surgeon ben carson raised far more and gop front-runner and real estate mogul donald trump is a billionaire, freeing him from the fundraising demands placed on other candidates.wisconsin donors led the way in contributions to walker\\'s presidential campaign with $1.1 million, followed by california backers with $522,000; $387,000 from texas donors; $367,000 from contributors in illinois; and $235,000 from new york supporters.last spring and early summer, walker rode high among polls and pundits alike, allowing his allied political group, the super pac unintimidated, to raise nearly $20 million between april and june alone. but during that time the governor was not an announced candidate for the white house and could not raise money for his actual campaign under federal election rules.the unlimited donations made to unintimidated can\\'t be used to pay any debts for walker\\'s presidential campaign.for his part, walker told conservative talk radio host charlie sykes wednesday that he wouldn\\'t focus on the mistakes, whether his own or those of his campaign staff.\"there were a lot of different factors, obviously different candidates, different situations, different staff. all of those things come. instead of doing what a lot of candidates do and whine about this, that or whatever, for me i accept it for what it is,\" walker told sykes.',\n",

       "    'top_k_doc': ['while there could have been other factors that contributed to the nearly five-fold increase in the male incarceration rate between the early 1970s and the peak in 2008, research clearly shows that the war on drugs, along with mandatory minimum sentencing in the 1980s and the disparate treatment of powdered cocaine and crack cocaine (powdered cocaine processed with baking soda into smokable rocks) were all significant contributing factors to the unprecedented rate of incarcerating americans. here are some conclusions from the 2014 book the growth of incarceration in the united states: exploring causes and consequences (my emphasis): if the real goal of the war on drugs was to target, convict and incarcerate subversive anti-war hippies and black americans, as ehrlichman describes it, it sure worked as the chart above of the male incarceration rate in the us shows. during the nearly 50-year period between 1925 and the early 1970s, the male incarceration rate was remarkably stable at about 200 men per 100,000 population, or 1 us male per 500, according to data from bureau of justice statistics. by 1986, about a decade after the war on drugs started locking up drug users and dealers in cages, the male incarceration rate doubled to 400 per 100,000 population. then within another decade, the male incarceration rate doubled again to more than 800 by 1996 before reaching a historic peak of 956 in 2008 (about one in 100) that was almost five times higher than the stable rate before the war on drugs. the arrest and incarceration data show that the war on drugs had a significantly much greater negative effect on blacks and hispanics than whites, making the drug war even more shameful for its devastating and disproportionate adverse effects on americas most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. the states combined incarceration rates increased across all crime categories between 1980 and 2010 (see chart above). most striking, however, is the dramatic increase in the incarceration rate for drug-related crimes. in 1980, imprisonment for drug offenses was rare, with a combined state incarceration rate of 15 per 100,000 population. by 2010, the drug incarceration rate had increased nearly 10-fold to 143 per 100,000. indeed, the rate of incarceration for the single category of drug-related offenses, excluding local jails and federal prisons, by itself exceeds by 50% the average incarceration rate for all crimes of western european countries and is twice the average incarceration rate for all crimes of a significant number of european countries. arrest rates for federal drug offenses climbed in the 1970s, and mandatory prison time for these offenses became more common in the 1980s. mandatory prison sentences, intensified enforcement of drug laws, and long sentences contributed not only to overall high rates of incarceration but also especially to extraordinary rates of incarceration in black and latino communities. intensified enforcement of drug laws subjected blacks, more than whites, to new mandatory minimum sentencesdespite lower levels of drug use and no higher demonstrated levels of trafficking among the black than the white population. as a result of the lengthening of sentences and greatly expanded drug law enforcement and imprisonment for drug offenses, criminal defendants became more likely to be sentenced to prison and remained there significantly longer than in the past. the policy shifts that propelled the growth in incarceration had disproportionately large effects on african americans and latinos. indeed, serving time in prison has become a normal life event among recent birth cohorts of african american men who have not completed high school.']},\n",

       "    'top_k_doc': [\"donald trump has repeated throughout his presidential campaign that he opposed the iraq war before the march 19, 2003 invasion, often taking credit for his judgement and vision  claiming he knew it would destabilize the middle east. on feb. 13, in the most recent debate, trump said: i said it loud and clear, youll destabilize the middle east.' in the sept. 16, 2015 debate, trump claimed that he fought very, very hard against us  going into iraq, saying he could provide 25 different stories to prove his opposition. trump has even said that he was visited by people from the white house in attempt to silence him, because, he said, he was getting a disproportionate amount of publicity for his opposition to the war. there is no evidence that we could find, however, that he spoke against the war before it started, although we did find he expressed early concerns about the cost and direction of the war a few months after it started. others have looked, but no one else  including politifact and the washington post fact checker  has been able to find any evidence to support his claims, either. now, buzzfeed reports that trump indicated his support for war in a radio interview with shock jock howard stern on sept. 11, 2002  a little more than six months before the war started. stern asked trump directly if he supported going to war with iraq, and trump hesitantly responded, yeah, i guess so. we dont know if trump still felt the same way in march of 2003. we do, however, know two things after having reviewed multiple news archival services in search of trumps position on the war: trump had a financial interest in opposing the war in the weeks leading up to the war. the newark star-ledger, new jerseys largest newspaper, reported on march 12, 2003 that trump hotels and casino resorts planned to sell $485 million in junk-grade bonds this week in an effort to avoid a cash crunch later this year. the uncertainty of war complicated trumps bond sale. the company began planning for the sale of the bonds in december, and it was completed march 13,2003  six days before the war started. the star-ledger reported that the growing threat of war with iraqand a proposal to raise casino taxes and install video slot machines at new jerseys racetracks  made it more difficult for the company to find willing investors. after the sale of the bonds was completed, trump issued a statement on march 13 saying he was pleased with the results despite difficult capital market conditions and the looming threat of war. trump expressed concerns about the cost of the war soon after it started. if trump did support the war, he turned on it quickly. as the timeline below shows, trump in july said that he wished the money being spent in iraq could be spent in new york city. by november, he talked about the tremendous cost of the war and the very, very unpleasant surprises in iraq. by 2004, trumps opposition to the war was well documented. donald j. trump took a moment to separate himself from his rivals by declaring that he had gone on the record with his opposition of the iraq war some 11 years ago  in july 2004. the claim, however, left out the reality that his opposition came well after the war was already underway. the war began in march 2003. it was that next year that mr. trump spoke against the war, in interviews with esquire and larry king. trump may have privately opposed the war prior to the march 2003 invasion, but no public evidence of his opposition could be found through a lexis-nexis search of news articles and transcripts.\"]},\n",

coaches and even owners. it comes in the wake of president donald trump\\'s recent comments and tweets on protests during the anthem. it started early sunday morning in london, as more than a dozen baltimore ravens and jacksonville jaguars players knelt during the u.s. national anthem at wembley stadium. the kneeling players then stood for the singing of the u.k. national anthem. ravens coach john harbaugh, jaguars coach doug marrone and jaguars owner shad khan stood with the players during the anthem. trump on friday night criticized nfl players who lodge protests during the national anthem. speaking at a political rally in huntsville, alabama, trump said: \"wouldn\\'t you love to see one of these nfl owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \\'get that son of a bitch off the field right now. out. he\\'s fired! he\\'s fired!\" on sunday, trump tweeted he was pleased to see so many nfl players locking arms while also decrying those who knelt. he later tweeted the nfl needed to change its policy concerning anthem protests. ravens linebacker terrell suggs, however, said it was trump\\'s comments that incited some players to kneel, including himself. \"personally, i think the comments made about my brothers who decided to protest and kneel is kind of what made us no longer be silent,\" suggs said. \"we stand with our brothers. they have the right to protest. we knelt with them today. non-violent protest is as american as it gets. we knelt with them today and let them know we are a unified front. there is no dividing us. i guess we\\'re all

strongly about it today. so i did what i did. i didn\\'t need anybody to tell me yes, no, whatever. that was just the way i felt.\" there was scattered booing by fans in all stadiums as protests were made sunday. in chicago, as the anthem began in soldier field, several pittsburgh steelers coaches were on the sideline, including coach mike tomlin, while the players were not present as they stayed in the locker room. the steelers players took the field within a few seconds of the anthem\\'s conclusion, just after the fireworks launch, with quarterback ben roethlisberger one of the first out of the tunnel. left tackle alejandro villanueva, an army ranger who served in afghanistan, was seen on the cbs broadcast at the edge of the tunnel during the anthem, hand over heart. the seattle seahawks and tennessee titans also stayed in the locker room during the national anthem before their game in nashville later sunday afternoon. \"we showed we have power as people and that\\'s what we were doing today. i think that it was super impressive,\" seahawks defensive lineman michael bennett said after the seahawks\\' 33-27 loss. an nfl official told espn nfl insider adam schefter that no fines are being considered for those players who stayed in the locker room during the anthem. nfl owners were among those across the league who responded this weekend to president trump\\'s comments and tweets. new england patriots owner robert kraft on sunday became the first nfl owner who made a donation to trump\\'s campaign to speak out. \"i am deeply disappointed by the tone of the comments made by the president on friday,\" kraft said. \"i am proud to be associated with so many players who make such tremendous contributions in positively impacting our communities. their efforts, both on and off the field, help bring people together and make our community stronger.\" during the playing of the anthem prior to the patriots\\' game against the houston texans, tom brady stood and locked arms while 20 or so of his teammates knelt. all of the texans stood and locked arms. new orleans saints running backs adrian peterson, mark ingram and alvin kamara were among a group of 10 players who sat on the bench during the national anthem for the first time sunday at carolina. no saints players had sat or knelt during the anthem before -- though they did organize a teamwide display of unity and hand-holding with the rival falcons after the anthem on a monday night football game last year. saints quarterback drew brees was among those standing for the anthem. after the game, he passionately explained why he\\'d continue to do so. \"i will always feel that, if you are an american, that the national anthem is the opportunity for us all to stand up together, to be unified, and to show respect for our country,\" brees said. \"to show respect for what it stands for, the birth of our nation. there will always be issues with our country, there will always be things we\\'re battling. and we should always strive to make those things better. but if the protests become that we\\'re going to sit down, or kneel, or not show the respect to the flag of the united states of america and everything that it symbolizes, everything it stands for, and everything our country has been through to get to this point... i do not agree with that. \"i feel like that is a unifying thing. the national anthem and standing for the national anthem, and looking at the flag with a hand over the heart is a unifying thing that should bring us all together. and say, \\'you know what? we know things are not where they should be, but we\\'re going to work and strive to make things better.\\' to bring equality to all people -- men, women, no matter your race, creed, religion, it doesn\\'t matter. equality for all. but if you\\'re an american, then i will always believe that we should be standing, showing respect for our flag, with our hand over our heart.\" philadelphia eagles owner jeffrey lurie, executives and players locked arms with servicemen and women and police officers during the playing of the anthem, and safety malcolm jenkins -- who has been demonstrating for social justice since week 2 of last season -- continued to raise his first above his head. defensive end chris long has placed an arm around jenkins as a sign of support since the events in his hometown of charlottesville, virginia, in august. he was joined by several teammates surrounding jenkins this week. wide receivers torrey smith and marcus johnson also raised their fists. green bay packers tight end martellus bennett, who had stood with his fist raised for the past two games, instead sat on the bench during the anthem. he was joined by teammates lance kendricks and kevin king as other packers players linked arms in two ground on their sideline. dolphins owner stephen ross, falcons owner arthur blank and vikings owners zygi and mark wilf were on the field with their teams, locking arms with players while the anthem was played. blank said he stood on the sideline not only to show support for the players and coaches, but also to back his public statement denouncing president trump\\'s criticism of players protesting during the anthem. across the field, tampa bay buccaneers players desean jackson and mike evans knelt during the anthem. in detroit, anthem singer rico lavelle took a knee and raised his fist at the conclusion of the song. detroit lions owner martha ford and her three daughters, who are usually long gone from the field by the time player introductions begin, remained on the sideline as detroit\\'s team was introduced and stood next to jim caldwell with linked arms. fans booed the lions as they protested, which included eight players linking arms while kneeling. the crowd in indianapolis also booed loudly as the colts locked arms and some knelt. about 20 cleveland browns players -- all african-american -- knelt during the anthem. browns running back duke johnson, in a group standing behind those who knelt -- apparently in support -- waved the crowd on. the entire buffalo bills sideline took the unusual step of walking about 10 yards toward the middle of the field for the national anthem. several players then knelt for the national anthem. more than 30 players from the denver broncos knelt during the anthem, including members of the practice squad. every new york jets player, coach and staff member linked arms during the anthem. acting owner christopher johnson, the younger brother of owner woody johnson, was among them. for the first time, there were players on the new york giants -- damon harrison, olivier vernon and landon collins -- who knelt during the anthem. other players stood with arms locked. more than 10 kansas city chiefs players sat during the anthem. on the opposing sideline, most los angeles chargers players locked arms, a few sat down and one -- melvin ingram -- took a knee. \"i have tremendous respect for our flag and the men and women who defend it,\" said a statement by chargers owner dean spanos, who stood with players, coaches and gm tom telesco with locked arms. \"ours is the greatest nation in the world, one in which people are able to speak freely and stand up publicly for their beliefs. our players, as do all americans, have every right to speak their mind and from their heart. it was an honor to join them on the field today.\" the carolina panthers stood for the anthem, as they have since the season began. julius peppers was not on the field, however, and said after the game that he made the choice to do so because he felt it was the appropriate thing to do. \"i want to get one thing clear,\" peppers said. \"this wasn\\'t about disrespecting the military, the flag, police, first responders, none of that. it was about me making a decision as a man on my own two feet, and i wasn\\'t going to ask somebody else to do anything with me. \"i just thought it was appropriate to stay in because we know what went on this week with the comments that were made by the president. i felt like he attacked our brothers, my brothers in the league, so i felt that it was appropriate to stand up with them and stay in the locker room.\" panthers coach ron rivera, meanwhile, said he believes that all players should continue to stand. \"we need to look at the flag and listen to the national anthem,\" rivera said. \"we need to think it and vision it for an america that we believe in, that is free from injustice, free from bigotry and free from prejudice. then when you guys ask me, we tell you that ... we believe in america, that we support our military, we support our first responders and we most certainly do not believe in racism and bigotry and we want to see that out of this country.\" the cincinnati bengals also continued to stand for the anthem -- most with their arms linked. a few stood with their hands on their hearts. nobody on the bengals has kneeled during the national anthem since the protests began last year. \"football and politics don\\'t mix easily,\" said a statement issued by the bengals prior to the game. \"fans come to nfl games to watch great competition on the playing field and that\\'s where our focus should be.\" washington redskins owner dan snyder linked arms with corners bashaud breeland and josh norman during the national anthem before the sunday night game against the oakland raiders. the entire team linked arms, but seven players opted to take a knee: receivers jamison crowder, josh doctson and brian quick, tight end niles paul and jordan reed and linebackers ryan anderson and chris carter. raiders coach jack del rio said the team wanted to stay in the locker room during the anthem but because of the timing of prime-time games, they could not because they would have missed the coin toss and also have been penalized. most of the raiders remained seated or took a knee during the anthem, including the entire offensive line, which is comprised of all minority players and is the lone all-black starting unit in the nfl, and the defensive line. some stood with interlocked arms, as did del rio, and quarterback derek carr appeared to pray while looking skyward and standing. in addition, the nfl re-aired a 60-second spot -- called \"inside these lines\" -- during the sunday night game that also appeared during super bowl li. the nfl describes it as a video that \"demonstrates the power of football to bring people together.\"']},\n",

    "The goal of the following tokenizer function is to introduce some normalizations - e.g. for covid, for numbers, for dates, for crore, such that we aid BM25 into recognizing simlarities in the words.\n",

    "Numbers in BM25\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tokenization:\n",
    "        When tokenizing text, numbers are typically split based on spaces or punctuation, just like words. For example:\n",
    "            \"In 2023, 10% of users\" → Tokens: [\"In\", \"2023\", \"10\", \"of\", \"users\"].\n",
    "        Each number is treated as an independent token, similar to a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scoring:\n",
    "        BM25 assigns a term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) to numbers just like it does to any other word.\n",
    "        If a number (e.g., \"2023\") appears frequently in both the query and the document, it will contribute to the document's relevance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implications:\n",
    "        Numbers in claims and evidence (e.g., \"86,000\" or \"5%\") are matched based on their exact representation.\n",
    "        BM25 does not understand numerical relationships or semantic context. For example:\n",
    "            It cannot recognize that \"10%\" is similar to \"0.1\" or \"10 percent\".\n",
    "            It does not reason about magnitudes or intervals (e.g., \"86,000\" vs. \"85,000\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Treating Numbers as Words\n",
    "\n",
    "    Exact Match Dependency:\n",
    "        If the number format in the query does not exactly match the format in the document (e.g., \"10%\" vs. \"10 percent\"), BM25 will not treat them as equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    No Numerical Reasoning:\n",
    "        BM25 cannot interpret numerical relations like comparisons (\"greater than\", \"equal to\") or ranges (\"10-20\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    Potential for Noise:\n",
    "        Numbers that are irrelevant to the query might still appear frequently in documents, leading to noise in retrieval.\n"
