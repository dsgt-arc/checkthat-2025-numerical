       " '869': 'during 2020, a total of 45,979 deaths were attributable to suicide, a decrease of 1,532 from 47,511 suicide deaths in 2019 (table). from 2019 to 2020, the overall suicide rate declined significantly by 3.0% (from 13.9 to 13.5 per 100,000 population). among racial/ethnic groups, overall, suicide rates in 2020 were highest among persons who were non-hispanic american indian or alaska native (23.9 per 100,000), non-hispanic white (16.9 per 100,000), and non-hispanic native hawaiian or other pacific islander (12.5 per 100,000). non-hispanic white persons experienced a 4.5% decline in suicide rate; no other changes among racial/ethnic groups were significant. rates in 2020 were highest among persons aged 85 years (20.9 per 100,000), followed by those aged 7584 and 2534 years (both 18.4 per 100,000). firearms accounted for approximately one half (24,292; 53%) of suicides in 2020; the rate of suicide by firearm did not change significantly between 2019 and 2020. rates of suicide by fall, poisoning, and suffocation declined significantly, with more than 100, nearly 600, and more than 1,000 fewer deaths by these means, respectively. suicide was among the 10 leading causes of death in the united states in 2020 among persons aged 1064 years, and the second leading cause of death among children and adolescents aged 1014 and adults aged 2534 years (1). during 19992020, nearly 840,000 lives were lost to suicide in the united states. during that period, the overall suicide rate peaked in 2018 and declined in 2019 and 2020 (1). despite the recent decline in the suicide rate, factors such as social isolation, economic decline, family stressors, new or worsening mental health symptoms, and disruptions to work and school associated with the covid-19 pandemic have raised concerns about suicide risk in the united states. during 2020, a total of 12.2 million u.s. adults reported serious thoughts of suicide and 1.2 million attempted suicide (2). to understand how changes in suicide death rates might have varied among subpopulations, cdc analyzed counts and age-adjusted suicide rates during 2019 and 2020 by demographic characteristics, mechanism of injury, county urbanization level, and state. from 2019 to 2020, the suicide rate declined by 3% overall, including 8% among females and 2% among males. significant declines occurred in seven states but remained stable in the other states and the district of columbia. despite two consecutive years of declines, the overall suicide rate remains 30% higher compared with that in 2000 (1). a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention that uses data driven decision-making and implements prevention strategies with the best available evidence, especially among disproportionately affected populations (3), is critical to realizing further declines in suicide and reaching the national goal of reducing the suicide rate by 20% by 2025 (4).',\n",
