Task 3: Fact-Checking Numerical Claims

Data needs to be downloaded and put in data/ folder locally. 

### Raw claims data
* data/English/train_claims_quantemp.json can be downloaded from the gitlab page https://gitlab.com/checkthat_lab/clef2025-checkthat-lab/-/tree/main/task3
* data/English/val_claims_quantemp.json can be downloaded from the gitlab page https://gitlab.com/checkthat_lab/clef2025-checkthat-lab/-/tree/main/task3

### Raw Evidence data:
* The full evidence corpus can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GYzSK0oU2MiaKbyBO3hE8kO4gdmxDjCv
* The BM25 top-100 processed data can be downloaded from: NOTE(!) This dataset is still wrong and not mapping precisely between number of doc_id and the top100 evidences, better not use it  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f8stxtVT785NvGHrNkRoN1Z69jOuU-Jp

#### See also discussion here for explanation on the datasets (so far). 
All the processed datasets are subject to change still, so the only reliable pieces of data that can be used now (e.g. for exploration) are the raw claims and the raw evidence.
